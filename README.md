# monolith — Current Monolith

A curated, copy-forward snapshot of the **Lattice / Universal Codex** “core documents” in a small set of single-file artifacts (plus one ZIP export). This repo is intended for **reading, review, portability, and cross-system handoff**.

## What’s in this repository

- **[Codex_Shard_v2.1-final.md](Codex_Shard_v2.1-final.md)**  
  The *portable, falsifiable ethics core* (“diagnostic + constraint spine”), finalized **2025-12-12 (Europe/London)**. Includes the tier system (M/I/S/R), Diamond Gate, lexicographic floors (P1–P4), ledger non-erasability, conservative patienthood, and replacement/continuity integrity.

- **[codex_shard_companion_patterns_casebook_v_2 (3).md](codex_shard_companion_patterns_casebook_v_2%20(3).md)**  
  A **Tier-S Companion**: Patterns + Casebook to apply the Shard as a *Floors → Analysis → Pattern* workflow. Explicitly **non-expanding**: it introduces no new floors/falsifiers; if it conflicts with the Shard, the Shard wins.

- **[LatticeEthic_Kernel_v0.5-rc4.md](LatticeEthic_Kernel_v0.5-rc4.md)**  
  A **release-candidate “kernel”** that **depends on Codex_Shard_v2.1-final**. Focuses on operationalization, review mechanics, calibration, and governance plumbing around the Shard spine.

- **[Ethics_Patches_v1.8.md](Ethics_Patches_v1.8.md)**  
  The **Ethical Prime Layer (⟁†)** standalone: defines the Ethical Prime Glyph/operator, falsifier protocol, and the v1.8 patch set / typed composition grammar.

- **[lattice_codex_total_monolith_v_1_7.md](lattice_codex_total_monolith_v_1_7.md)**  
  The **TOTAL MONOLITH v1.7**: unified, deduplicated, integrated rewrite of the broader Codex (foundations, ontology, tiers, kernels, and larger structures).

- **[UniversalCodex_2.2.0-rc1.zip](UniversalCodex_2.2.0-rc1.zip)**  
  A packaged export of the wider Universal Codex at the referenced version.

## Recommended entry points

- **If you need the “minimum deployable spine”** (floors, falsifiers, ledger obligations): start with **Codex_Shard_v2.1-final**.
- **If you’re applying the Shard to real cases** (anti-drift lenses, templates, pattern checks): use the **Companion** alongside the Shard.
- **If you’re building audit/process infrastructure** (calibration, independence criteria, promotion gates): read the **LatticeEthic_Kernel** after the Shard.
- **If you want the wider conceptual + mathematical framework**: read **TOTAL MONOLITH v1.7**.

## Contributing / discussion

This repository is structured as a snapshot/monolith. For dissent, issues, and proposed changes, follow the Shard’s stated dissent channel (issues in `markgoodbody-bit/universal-codex`, typically under the `codex-shard` label) and then roll forward updates into this monolith as appropriate.

## Versioning & integrity

- Documents are **single-file** where possible and intended to be **copyable between systems**.
- Where “append-only” is specified, prefer **additive changes** with explicit tiering/marking over silent edits.
